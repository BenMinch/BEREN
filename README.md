## What BEREN does
BEREN is a comprehensive pipeline for accessing the diversity and functional potential of giant viruses (NCLDV) and Preplasmiviricota viruses (Polinton-like viruses, Virophages, Polintons) in metagenomes. It can be used to get overall diversity (marker genes), longer contigs, and genomes of these eukaryotic viruses and predict their functional potential and taxonomy. BEREN is modular so you can choose which modules to run on a given sample.
